**Procedural horse race**



**Set Up the Race**

The race track is 15 positions long.

Each horse starts at position 0.

The race continues until one horse reaches or passes position 15.


**Start the Race Loop**

The race keeps running in a loop until a horse wins.

Before each round, the screen clears to update the race display. 



**Move the Horses**

Each horse has a 50% chance of moving forward each turn.

If a horse moves forward, its position increases by 1. 



**Display the Race Track**

The program prints a visual representation of the race track for each horse.

A . represents an empty track position.

The horse's number is displayed at its current position.



**Check for a Winner**

After moving, the program checks if any horse has reached the finish line (position 15).

If a horse has won, it announces: Horse 2 WINS!!!

The race ends immediately when a winner is found. 



**Continue Until a Winner**

If no horse has won, the program pauses and waits for the player to press Enter before continuing to the next round.

This process repeats until a horse reaches the finish line.

When a horse wins, the program stops running and displays the winner.
